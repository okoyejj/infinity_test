# infinity_test

Create a cron job running every minut to execute task.php 
#syntax
#* * * * * /usr/bin/php /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/php_daemon/cron.php >/dev/null$
#replace folder path with where file is found

#comments from file actually show logic taken to try and solve the task.
#to run the script (*.sh) file go to the terminal and type chmod 755 cronscript (cron cannot be run from within php unfortunately.)
 
 
 #No syntax for database creation was written as that was not recommended
